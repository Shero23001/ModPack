Should you accidentally become stored, Alterra Corp will send a complimentary condolence card to your listed next-of-kin.\n\nLEGAL NOTICE: In Psychologists United v. Alterra Corp, the justices held that explaining the [redacted] technology (even at a cursory level for the purposes of marketing and intimidating the competition with large, hard to understand technical terms) used a nearly lethal level of technical jargon and that its description to a layman, engineer, or doctoral candidate constituted the wanton infliction of gross mental harm and emotional torture. Its use in warfare was banned by a special session of the Geneva Convention.\n\nAlterra Corporation has been enjoined from saying more than the following:\n\n  - the technology was developed for Alterra Yummy-Nummy Pizzerias -- delivered in 30 Seconds Or Less Or Your Pizza Is Free!\n  - that it involves sucking scanned items into its own temporally distinct, zero-dimension pocket universe and pulling it back out\n  - that the pseudo-address of the item is quantum-encoded into the Data Disk rather than the matter being somehow \u2018digitized\u2019 (physical laws apply to Alterra Corp, though management often disagrees), which is why every item, big or small, uses the same amount of storage space\n\nAlterra Corporation thanks you for your patience as it complies with the court's order to \"just shut up and call it 'Data Storage\u2019 -- and don\u2019t you dare say \u2018if you\u2019d just let me explain how cool it is\u2019 to me again!\"",
