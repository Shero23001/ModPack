      "Body": "Alterra SpaceTime Solutions, a subsidiary of the EPR Research Division, is excited to bring you the Alterra Quantum Travel line of products. \n\nQuantum Travel gives you all the benefits of physically going places without any of that tedious mucking about going from here to there: no traffic, no worries about the weather, and no getting trapped in the gravitational field of your favorite ice cream stand that you can\u2019t break free of even though it means an extra 20 minutes on the treadmill. With the Alterra Quantum Travel product family, you\u2019re right at your destination with the push of a button.\n\nDisclaimer: The EPR Research Division, named in honor of the famous 1935 paper by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, wishes to categorically wash its hands of the slanderous marketing term of \u201cQuantum Teleportation.\u201d True Quantum Teleportation refers to the transfer of quantum state information and not physical objects. Further, it wishes to make clear that SpaceTime Solutions works with modified field equations to create a quasi-stable form of Einstein-Rosen Bridge. Marketing\u2026what a bunch of jerks.\n\nYour mission has licensed four items from the Alterra Quantum Travel Catalog: \n      - Quantum Power Bank\n      - Quantum Power Bank Charger\n      - Quantum Teleporter\n      - Quantum Teleporter Vehicle Pad\n\nWARNING: Energy costs represent the energy paid by each teleport device, the sender and the receiver must independently have that energy cost available.\n\nINTER-/INTRA-BASE TELEPORTATION\n\nFor Inter-Base and Intra-Base Teleportation, two Alterra Quantum Teleporters are used.\n\nThe Alterra Quantum Teleporter maintains two operating networks, Home and Global.\n\nThe Home Network \n - is made up of Quantum Teleporters that are part of the Habitat region. \n - transfer is instantaneous \n - uses very little power (150 energy by each teleporter)\n - each Quantum Teleporter is automatically listed in the Home Network\n\nThe Global network\n - is made up of Quantum Teleporters that are not part of the Habitat region. \n - transfer is very fast but not instantaneous\n - uses quite a bit of power (1,500 energy by each teleporter)\n - each Quantum Teleporter must be manually added to the Global Network -- often only one Quantum Teleporter in each Base is sufficient\n\nIn the Quantum Teleporter interface, Home and Global network selections are on the left. On the right is the option to list the current Quantum Teleporter on the Global Network and the option to rename that Quantum Teleporter. Naming each Quantum Teleporter makes knowing where you are going just that much easier.\n\nWhen selecting a teleport destination, the power available at the destination will be viewable.\n\nAWAY-FROM-BASE TELEPORTATION\n\nFor Away-From-Base Teleportation, the FCStudios PDA serves as the origin with a Quantum Teleporter (for personal transportation) or a Quantum Teleporter Vehicle Pad (for vehicle transportation) serving as the destination. \n\nPower for the outbound connection is provided by a Quantum Power Bank which you must have about your person.\n\nTeleportation is initiated from the Teleportation section of the FCStudios PDA.\n\nThe Quantum Power Bank holds a charge of 3000 units, sufficient to teleport the mass of a person two times or the mass of a vehicle one time.\n\nThe Alterra Quantum Power Bank is a Parallel Pulse Discharge (PPD) storage unit, able to discharge in several picoseconds, sufficient to energize the substrate material in the FCStudios PDA to create a sufficiently rigid and anisotropic Einstein-Rosen equation state and open a single-sided Einstein-Rosen bridge to the selected destination.\n\nNota Bene: the PPD storage medium is altered at the quantum level during the discharge, rendering it inert. Due to manufacturing difficulty, devices using PPD are only suitable for emergency situations.\n\nThe Alterra Quantum Power Bank Charger will \u201crepackage\u201d a viable PPD storage medium into the Quantum Power Bank. A new \u201cstorage medium material\u201d will be required each time the Quantum Power Bank is placed in the Quantum Power Bank Charger.\n\n\nThe Alterra Quantum Teleporter and the Alterra Quantum Teleporter Vehicle Pad serve as end-point destinations for personal and vehicle teleportation respectively. \n\nPlease Note:\n      - Personal Teleportation: Only Alterra Quantum Teleporters on the Global Network are viable destinations.\n      - Vehicle Teleportation: Careful consideration should be given to the placement of the Alterra Quantum Teleporter Vehicle Pad so that it does not interfere with base structures or base traffic patterns.\n\nAlterra Quantum Travel: when being late isn\u2019t your fault, it\u2019s your observer\u2019s.",
