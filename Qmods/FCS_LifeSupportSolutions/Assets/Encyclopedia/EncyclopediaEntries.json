These absolutely scandalous and perjurious prevarications are categorically false and can be completely disregarded: Alterra Med Bays of all sizes are perfectly safe. We promise.\n\nAn automatic medical scan is completed when you step on the platform. Should any physical injury be detected, you can begin automated treatment by placing your hand on the Heart emblem in the interface.\n\nFor your convenience, the Mini Med Bay has been upgraded to automatically create 6 Health Kits rated for use in hostile environments.\n\nNota Bene: The Alterra Mini Med Bay can only diagnose and repair physical injuries. For psychological diagnosis and treatment, please see your Alterra Corp representative for a brochure for the Alterra Psychological Support Digital Catalog. (Seriously, please! Do you know how hard it is to talk Mission Planning into licensing the Psychological Support catalog? You can\u2019t just subsidize alcohol all the time! \u2018We can repair the liver damage,\u2019 I mean, come ON! )\n\nThe Alterra Mini Med Bay: you break it, we license you a way to fix it",

      "Body": "The Alterra Base Oxygen Tank is a time-tested design that still sees service everywhere there isn\u2019t air. No fancy technology, no routine maintenance, it just filters and pressurizes surface air to supply your Habitat. \n\nThis comparatively low-yield device was designed with small, near-surface Habitats in mind; however, there is no technical limit on depth or distance so long as air can be supplied to the Base Oxygen Tank.\n\n[Notice: Duplicate Product Detected in Mission PDA. Congratulations! It seems your mission licensed the blueprint for the Base Oxygen Tank as a safety measure. Because of this, your Builder Tool will have two options for building the Base Oxygen Tank, using either local materials or an AlterraKit.]\n\nBasic Setup:\n  - Attach the Base Oxygen Tank\n  - Float an Air Pump to the surface \n  - Connect the Floating Air Pump to Base Oxygen Tank with air tubing\n     - Connecting: air tubing will automatically connect when in range\n     - Disconnecting: you must manually disconnect the pipe at the connector before the air tubing can be collected\n\nCaveats: \n  - A Floating Air Pump only delivers enough air for one Base Oxygen Tank\n  - The Base-attached Air Pump cannot be used due to insufficient airflow and lapsed licensing agreements\n\nThe Base Oxygen Tank works with the built-in air movers present in each Habitat Module to move air through the Habitat but lacks both the oxygen output and the integrated support technology for optimal oxygen distribution that are present in the Base Utility Unit (see Life Support > Base Utility Unit).\n\nSupplying your Habitat with sufficient air is important. If Habitat size exceeds the Base Oxygen Tank carrying capacity, it will be harder to breathe and recharge air tanks. The Base Oxygen Tank will display important capacity information to your always-up display when you are in range, telling you the number of Active and Required Tanks (e.g. Active Tanks: 1, Required Tanks: 1.2).\n\nPlanning for your air needs ahead of time may be crucial for your survival. In general, the Base Oxygen Tank can support 2 large Habitat modules or 10 smaller modules and connector modules, mixed in any combination. For example, an outpost consisting of a Multipurpose Room, Scanner Room, two connector modules, and an Observatory would display \u201cRequired Tanks: .9\u201d\n\nThe Alterra Base Oxygen Tank: bringing you the best in\u2026 Oh come on, who are we kidding? We don\u2019t really want to sell these -- they aren\u2019t really profitable -- but we want to keep you alive so you can Buy, Share, and Enjoy the rest of the great line of Alterra Products and Services such as the Base Utility Unit, available now at your nearest Alterra Hub.",

(NB: the large Water Filtration Machine draws in outside fluid directly and does not offer this benefit)\n\nOxygen:\n\nThe Unified Material Manifold provides oxygen at high pressure and intelligently operates the air processing membranes in each base module's air handler system, providing optimal atmospheric balance. Base Utility Units use an Adaptive-Collaboration Design allowing multiple Base Utility Units to work together seamlessly.
